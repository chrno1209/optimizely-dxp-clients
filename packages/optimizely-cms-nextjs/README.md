> [!TIP]
> Looking to implement a new Next.js based site with Optimizely SaaS CMS? The easiest way to get started is our [project template]([http](https://github.com/remkoj/optimizely-saas-starter)).

This package provides the needed components to implement a Next.js based frontedn for Optimizely SaaS CMS, with full support for the preview capabilities of Optimizely CMS.

[Release notes](https://github.com/remkoj/optimizely-dxp-clients/releases)

## Features
### Catch-all route rendering
Default implementation of the Catch-All route in Next.js to allow rendering any page created and managed by editors.

```typescript
// In `src/app/[[...path]]/page.tsx`

import { CmsPage as OptimizelyCmsPage } from "@remkoj/optimizely-cms-nextjs"
import getFactory from '@/components/factory' // Or any other file where you have your component factory defined.
import { getContentByPath } from "@/gql/functions" // Or any other file that has the `getContentByPath` function

const { CmsPage, generateMetadata, generateStaticParams } = OptimizelyCmsPage.createPage(getFactory(), {
    getContentByPath: getContentByPath
})

// Configure the Next.JS route handling for the pages
export const dynamic = "error"; // Make sure we're leveraging SSG for CMS managed pages.
export const dynamicParams = true; // Allow new pages to be resolved without rebuilding the site.
export const revalidate = false; // Keep the cache untill manually revalidated using the Webhook.
export const fetchCache = "default-cache"; // Cache fetch results by default, while allowing an opt-out.

// Export CMS Page
export {
    generateMetadata,
    generateStaticParams
}
export default CmsPage
```

The `createPage` method has many more options allowing you to take control over what is happening while the page renders. The options object has built-in documentation that your IDE can show if you've got JavaScript / TypeScript language support enabled.

### Cache invalidation
Default implementation to handle webhooks from Optimizely Graph to purge the Next.js cache based upon taht incoming request.

```typescript
// In `src/app/api/content/publish/route.ts`

import createPublishApi from '@remkoj/optimizely-cms-nextjs/publish'

const publishApi = createPublishApi(
    { 
        paths: [ '/', '/[[...path]]', '/sitemap.xml' ] // The list of fall-back paths to flush,
        optimizePublish: true // Use the data received from Graph to selectively flush the cache
    }
)

// Configure the Next.JS route handling for the pages
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'      // Make sure all API-Requests are executed
export const dynamicParams = true           // Make sure all matching routes are always executed
export const revalidate = 0                 // Don't cache
export const fetchCache = 'force-no-store'  // Don't cache
export const runtime = 'edge'               // Run at the edge

// Export API Handler
export const GET = publishApi
export const POST = publishApi
```

The `createPublishApi` method has many more options allowing you to take control over what is happening while the page renders. The options object has built-in documentation that your IDE can show if you've got JavaScript / TypeScript language support enabled.


### Middleware
The package provides the following enhancements for Next.js middleware:
| Wrapper | import | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| withEditFallback | `@remkoj/optimizely-cms-nextjs/preview` | Rewrite incoming Optimizely CMS 12 preview / on-page-edit URLs to Optimizely SaaS CMS preview  URLs |
| withLanguagePrefix | `@remkoj/optimizely-cms-nextjs/page` | Handle the redirect of the homepage `/` to the locale that best matches the incoming request, such as `/en`. The locales and their URLs are taken from the second parameter - the ChannelDefinition.

If you use both wrappers, the `withEditFallback` wrapper must wrap the `withLanguagePrefix` wrapper, to ensure that the edit mode URL is rewritten before the language prefix is applied.
